      <description>Does anything anchor what we should aim for in life? Does anything make life meaningful? How could we know? And what would be the alternative? Nihilism—that nothing matters? Or would life without an anchored meaning be absurd and pointless?
Reading  Robert Nozick, “The Experience Machine” excerpt from Anarchy, State, and Utopia (1974), the first part of this  Susan Wolf, “The Meanings of Lives” (2015) from The Variety of Values: Essays on Morality, Meaning, and Love, available here.</description>

      <description> Are different things true for different cultures—in their separate places and at different times in history? Do people in very different cultures live, in some way, in different worlds? And just within one culture, are things “socially constructed” in any meaningful way?
Reading  Sally Haslanger (1995) “Ontology and Social Construction” Read just section 2. James Rachels (1978) “The Challenge of Cultural Relativism” Read the whole thing; via Blackboard.

      <description>For this short unit, we look at a different question in metaphysics (the study of what there is, or what exists). Our last metaphysics question was What is personal identity? Now we ask Do races exist? We will spend this week on that.
For this reading, it is useful to know a philosophical term: “realist.” In Philosophy, someone who is a realist about X believes that X is real (for any X).</description>

      <description>Here we meet skepticism, the worry that we can&amp;rsquo;t have genuine knowledge, and then accounts of how we can have knowledge. This introduces us to Epistemology. We then see how epistemology connects with Metaphysics, in seeing how accounts of how we know are related to accounts of what we are. We&amp;rsquo;ll do this by focusing on two early modern philosophers and some their critics, past and present.
Reading  René Descartes, “First Meditation and Second Meditation” from Meditations on First Philosophy in Which Are Demonstrated the Existence of God and the Distinction Between the Human Soul and Body.</description>

      <description>Next we turn to when, whether, and why are compelled to obey laws.
Reading  Plato, Crito (early 4th century BCE), translated by Cathal Woods and Ryan Pack (2012), available from SSRN, or this alternative version. Read pages 1, 2, and 7–9 of this 10-page text (the rest is optional). Martin Luther King Jr., “Letter from Birmingham Jail,”1 (1963), available here. Consider reading the whole thing, but our discussion will concern paragraphs 9–18 (from “You may well ask: ‘Why direct action?</description>

      <description>A basic organizing structure for philosophy is the argument. Arguments are sets of statements where one of the statements is a conclusion. What knits them together is logic. We will think about what arguments are and then learn some basic ideas of logic.
Reading  “Basic Ideas and Tools,” Chapter 1 of A Modern Formal Logic Primer by Edmund Teller, sections 1-1 to 1-4, or equivalently pages 1–10 of Volume 1.</description>

      <description>This brief topic offers a basic philosophical problem with a very long history. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting problem, but we&amp;rsquo;re also starting with it to get a first look at philosophical methodology and the structure of arguments and counter-arguments.
Reading  Daniel Dennett, Elbow Room: The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting (1984), 2 brief excerpts, 4 pages (Blackboard)  See also  In the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy:  Causal Determinism Free Will Compatibilism Skepticism about Moral Responsibility  Entertaining movies on this topic include Memento and Minority Report.</description>

      <description>Prominent philosopher Martha Nussbaum was recently asked “How would you define the role of a philosopher in today’s world?” She answered:
 I wouldn’t. There are so many good ways to engage with the world, and each philosopher should figure it out for herself. I don’t like telling others what to do.
 Still, philosophy has a history. And its history involves people doing specific things and calling them “philosophy,” and not calling other things “philosophy.</description>
