      <description>Does anything anchor what we should aim for in life? Does anything make life meaningful? How could we know? And what would be the alternative? Nihilism—that nothing matters? Or would life without an anchored meaning be absurd and pointless?
Reading  Robert Nozick, “The Experience Machine” excerpt from Anarchy, State, and Utopia (1974), the first part of this  Susan Wolf, “The Meanings of Lives” (2015) from The Variety of Values: Essays on Morality, Meaning, and Love, available here.</description>

      <description>Are different things true for different cultures—in their separate places and at different times in history? Do people in very different cultures live, in some way, in different worlds? And just within one culture, are things “socially constructed” in any meaningful way?
Reading  Sally Haslanger (1995) “Ontology and Social Construction” Read just section 2. James Rachels (1984) “The Challenge of Cultural Relativism” Read the whole thing — link to be added.</description>

      <description>Below are the questions for our second test. The test will consist of some of the questions on this list. Expect six of them. The questions selected for the test will appear on the test exactly as they are written here (with the sole exception of corrections like spelling errors).
For each question, write at least five sentences, and perhaps more. Where an argument is sought, consider presenting it as a list of numbered sentences rather than in a paragraph.</description>

      <description>For this short unit, we look at a different question in metaphysics (the study of what there is, or what exists). Our last metaphysics question was What is personal identity? Now we ask Do races exist? We will spend this week on that.
For this reading, it is useful to know a philosophical term: “realist.” In Philosophy, someone who is a realist about X believes that X is real (for any X).</description>

      <title>Topic 5: Knowing and Being</title>

      <description>Here we meet skepticism, the worry that we can&amp;rsquo;t have genuine knowledge, and then accounts of how we can have knowledge. This introduces us to Epistemology. We then see how epistemology connects with Metaphysics, in seeing how accounts of how we know are related to accounts of what we are. We&amp;rsquo;ll do this by focusing on two early modern philosophers and some their critics, past and present.

      <description>Pick a statement that reflects something you believe. This assignment might be slightly easier if it is a statement that not everyone believes, but it will work fine either way. It should be something that you want to think more about, and maybe a statement for which the justification is not obvious. The statement will function as the conclusion of three arguments you will create, following the instructions below. So, after you&amp;rsquo;ve picked a statement, do each of the following:</description>

      <description>Next we turn to when, whether, and why are compelled to obey laws.
Reading  Plato, Crito (early 4th century BCE), translated by Cathal Woods and Ryan Pack (2012), available from SSRN, or this alternative version. Read pages 1, 2, and 7–9 of this 10-page text (the rest is optional). Martin Luther King Jr., “Letter from Birmingham Jail,”1 (1963), available here. Consider reading the whole thing, but our discussion will concern paragraphs 9–18 (from “You may well ask: ‘Why direct action?</description>

      <description>A basic organizing structure for philosophy is the argument. Arguments are sets of statements where one of the statements is a conclusion. What knits them together is logic. We will think about what arguments are and then learn some basic ideas of logic.
Reading  “Basic Ideas and Tools,” Chapter 1 of A Modern Formal Logic Primer by Edmund Teller, sections 1-1 to 1-4, or equivalently pages 1–10 of Volume 1.</description>

      <description>This brief topic offers a basic philosophical problem with a very long history. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting problem, but we&amp;rsquo;re also starting with it to get a first look at philosophical methodology and the structure of arguments and counter-arguments.
Reading  Daniel Dennett, Elbow Room: The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting (1984), 2 brief excerpts, 4 pages (Blackboard)  See also  In the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy:  Causal Determinism Free Will Compatibilism Skepticism about Moral Responsibility  Entertaining movies on this topic include Memento and Minority Report.</description>

      <description>Prominent philosopher Martha Nussbaum was recently asked “How would you define the role of a philosopher in today’s world?” She answered:
 I wouldn’t. There are so many good ways to engage with the world, and each philosopher should figure it out for herself. I don’t like telling others what to do.
 Still, philosophy has a history. And its history involves people doing specific things and calling them “philosophy,” and not calling other things “philosophy.</description>

      <description>This is the participation rubric to be used for grading participation in this course. Read it as saying “A student who demonstrates … earns a grade of X,” where X is the letter grade at the top of the column.1
   A B C D F     Active role in discussions, drawing on texts Regular, constructive participation drawing on texts Inconsistent constructive participation based on texts Vague comments reflecting limited engagement with texts Persistent lack of engagement with texts   Full preparation for approximately every class Substantial preparation, normally Inconsistent evidence of preparation Rare evidence of participation No positive evidence of participation   Success at advancing level and depth of discussion, persistently Regular contributions based on assigned material, which sometimes improve discussion and never diminish it Rare or no significant contribution to the level of discussion while not reducing it Activity sometimes diminishing the discussion and the classroom environment Activity regularly diminishing the discussion and the classroom environment   Active engagement with and listening to peers, persistently Sincere efforts to interact with peers, normally Limited engagement with peers Rare interaction with peers No interaction with peers     This rubric is significantly based on, and lightly adapted from, one written by another philosophy professor, Jay Odenbaugh.</description>

      <description>This note about grading and interpreting grades just adds some detail to what the course syllabus already says about grading.
4-point scale Grades in this course are assigned and calculated using Hofstra&amp;rsquo;s 4-point scale (described here in the Hofstra Bulletin). Following the Bulletin, the alphabetical grades, including plus (+) and minus (–), have the following 4-point scale values (and vice versa):
