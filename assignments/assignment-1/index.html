<p>Pick a statement that reflects something you believe. This assignment might be slightly easier if it is a statement that not everyone believes, but it will work fine either way. It should be something that you want to think more about, and maybe a statement for which the justification is not obvious. The statement will function as the conclusion of three arguments you will create, following the instructions below. So, after you&rsquo;ve picked a statement, do each of the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Construct a <em>logically valid</em> argument that supports your conclusion and offers some reason to believe it is true. The ideal length is probably about three to five premises. Write out the argument in list form, with the premises numbered and the conclusion separated from the premises by a horizontal line.</p></li>

<li><p>Write at least 800 words answering the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Which one or two premises of your logically valid argument seem most likely to be questioned, for example by someone who is skeptical about the conclusion, whom you might use the argument to persuade?</li>
<li>Then, can you think of any strategies&mdash;whether or not you are sure that they would work&mdash;for offering further support for this questionable premise (or premises)? What are they?</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Now construct a second argument for the same conclusion-statement, but this time make it a logically <em>invalid</em> argument. Make the argument invalid in such a way that it still roughly sounds good &mdash; that is, in a way that is not necessarily completely obvious even to someone who is not thinking carefully. (For example, \&ldquo;I like chocolate / So, democracy is the best form of government\&rdquo; is an invalid argument, but it&rsquo;s not going to mislead anyone. Try to make the argument fail in a less obvious way.) Write out the argument in list form, as before.</p></li>

<li><p>Finally, write at least 300 words explaining what is wrong with this bad argument you&rsquo;ve created. Focus on the logic. Explain what&rsquo;s wrong it in a way that someone who is not in a philosophy course could understand your explanation.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><del>Though this is not a standard essay-style philosophy paper, please consult the &ldquo;Writing a Philosophy Paper&rdquo; handout on Blackboard for information about writing conventions and citation, in case you find you want to use information from a source. However, t</del> This is not a research paper, and researching will not contribute significantly to your grade. If you use any material from outside the class, please make sure that you have included a citation to it in *any <em>format</em> that allows me to find the specific source page.</p>

<p>The grading criteria for this assignment will be the clarity of your writing and the success at following the instructions.</p>

<p>Submit your assignment by uploading it through the First Assignment upload link under the <code>Assignments</code> button on the course&rsquo;s Blackboard site. Submit your assignment by <strong>October 11</strong> to be on time, or email me if you find you need to request additional time. You do not need to submit a copy on paper. On the assignment itself <strong>do not write your name</strong>, to facilitate anonymous reading and grading. Titling your assignment is optional. For your files, you might just put the course title, the date, and something like “First Assignment” at the top of the document.</p>
