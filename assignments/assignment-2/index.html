<p>Write at least 1300 words in response to <strong>one</strong> of the numbered topics below. Make sure to present arguments clearly. Also remember that a criticism of an argument cannot simply describe a different perspective or support a different conclusion; instead it must argue that there is a problem either with the target argument's logic or with one or more of its premises.</p>
<p>Write as if you're addressing someone who is not in the class and does not have a background in philosophy. Remember to support your attribution of ideas to authors with brief, focused quotations and page references. (Do this even if you choose one of the dialogue assignments.) Please consult the &ldquo;Writing a Philosophy Paper&rdquo; handout on Blackboard for information about writing conventions and citation.</p>
<p>Submit your assignment by uploading it through the First Assignment upload link under the <code>Assignments</code> button on the course's Blackboard site. Submit your assignment by <strong>December 4</strong> to be on time, or email me if you find you need to request additional time. You do not need to submit a copy on paper. On the assignment itself <strong>do not write your name</strong>, to facilitate anonymous reading and grading. Titling your assignment is optional. For your files, you might just put the course title, the date, and something like “First Assignment” at the top of the document.</p>

<p>Lay out clearly how different basic assumptions lead Root and Spencer to different conclusions about whether races exist. That is, what differences in their assumptions lead to differences in their conclusions? Then, in at least the final , imagine how each might be critical of the other's assumptions or reasoning.</p>

<li>
<p>Imagine that any two of the following three are in class together (pick two): Valerie Tiberius, Epictetus, Susan Wolf and Thomas Nagel. Their professor says, after class, &ldquo;So how are you going to decide what to do with your life?&rdquo; Consider how each would answer that question, and have them explain their answers by using questions from the other. Focus on bringing out their reasoning about what basic claims support other claims. Bring out the differences in their positions by having them each ask the other challenging questions and raise objections about the other's views.</p>
