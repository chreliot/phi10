<h1><span class="title">Test 1 Questions</span></h1>

</div>

<main>
<p>Below are the questions for our first test. The test will consist of some of the questions on this list. Expect five or six of them. The questions selected for the test will appear on the test exactly as they are written here. Write as though you&rsquo;re explaining the answer to another student who is not in the course (as opposed to discussing it with someone who is already familiar with the course material).</p>

<p>For each question, write at least five sentences, and perhaps more. Where an argument is sought, consider presenting it as a list of  numbered sentences rather than in a paragraph.</p>

<ol>
<li>In <em>Apology</em>, what does Socrates characterize the activity of philosophy as being? Then what are some difference he cites between philosophy and some activities that are similar to philosophy but don&rsquo;t count as philosophy?</li>
<li>What is an example of a question which used to be philosophical and is now scientific? What made it become a scientific question? What is a closely related question which is clearly philosophical?</li>
<li>What, in your view, is Blackburn&rsquo;s strongest case for the value of philosophy?</li>
<li>What are some benefits of trying to represent the support for conclusions as logically-connected premises? And how does doing that in turn clarify the two main ways we can reasonably argue against conclusions?</li>
<li>What is the definition of “logically valid” for arguments? Present a short example of an argument that has true premises and a true conclusion but is not logically valid.</li>
<li>What is the definition of “logically valid” for arguments? Present a short example of an argument that is logically valid but false premises and a false conclusion.</li>
<li>How might premises genuinely offer support for a conclusion even though the argument they are part of is not deductively valid? Give an example.</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s an argument that is logically valid in predicate logic, but not in sentential logic?</li>
<li>Why should we care if all our actions and everyone else&rsquo;s are causally determined? That is, what problems might that present?</li>
<li>What are two different logically-valid arguments for the conclusion that all actions are determined?</li>
<li>What does Dennett&rsquo;s example from Frankfurt show? How?</li>
<li>Generalizing on his speech in the <em>Crito</em>, where does Socrates think laws derive their binding force from?</li>
<li>How do you think King might argue for that legal positivism does not accurately capture the relationship between law and morality in the case of the laws of Birmingham?</li>
<li>What makes a law immoral, for King? What&rsquo;s an example (other than King&rsquo;s example), and why would it be immoral according to King&rsquo;s  standard?</li>
<li>What specific point does Hart disagree with in King&rsquo;s account of law? What basis could he offer for disagreement, as a legal positivist?</li>
<li>Why does Descartes think that the limitations of our senses and the possibility that we are dreaming are not the strongest possible reasons for doubt?</li>
<li>Does Descartes conclude that we can&rsquo;t know anything? Based on what he writes, why should we understand him as concluding that, or not?</li>
