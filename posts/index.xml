      <description>Below are the questions for our second test. The test will consist of some of the questions on this list. Expect six of them. The questions selected for the test will appear on the test exactly as they are written here (with the sole exception of minor corrections that don&#39;t change the meaning, like spelling errors).
For each question, write at least five sentences, and perhaps more. Write in complete, grammatical sentences.</description>

      <description>Below are the questions for our first test. The test will consist of some of the questions on this list. Expect five or six of them. The questions selected for the test will appear on the test exactly as they are written here. Write as though you&#39;re explaining the answer to another student who is not in the course (as opposed to discussing it with someone who is already familiar with the course material).</description>
