</div>

<main>
<p>Below are the questions for our second test. The test will consist of some of the questions on this list. Expect six of them. The questions selected for the test will appear on the test exactly as they are written here (with the sole exception of minor corrections that don't change the meaning, like spelling errors).</p>
<p>For each question, write at least five sentences, and perhaps more. Write in complete, grammatical sentences. Where an argument is sought, consider presenting it as a list of  numbered sentences rather than in a paragraph. Write as though you're explaining the answer to another student who is not in the course (as opposed to discussing it with someone who is already familiar with the course material).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This lis is now <strong>complete</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>How does Descartes justify that we can know things?</li>
<li>How does Descartes's justification of knowledge probably depend on circular reasoning?</li>
<li>What's potentially wrong with circular reasoning? Give an example (not from Descartes) to illustrate.</li>
<li>What is Elisabeth's argument against Descartes? That is, which main claim of his does she reject, and what reasons does she offer that it is mistaken?</li>
<li>How might a rationalist (like Descartes) argue that empiricism (like Locke's) cannot offer good support for justify knowledge, in comparison with rationalist justification?</li>
<li>What is the difference between natural kinds and artificial kinds? Offer an example of each and explain why it is natural or artificial.</li>
<li>How, according to Root, can race be both invented and real, as Du Bois had suggested?</li>
<li>Which premise of Root's does Spencer contest, and how/why?</li>
<li>What reasons does Spencer offer for the view that a specific meaning of &ldquo;race&rdquo; is real?</li>
<li>How does relativism differ from the view that nothing is true? Explain.</li>
<li>What kind of evidence and reasoning supports general relativism (or in other words, relativism about all facts)?</li>
<li>Why might general relativism be self-refuting?</li>
<li>What's an example of something that is discursively socially constructed, according to Haslanger? Explain why it is, according to her.</li>
<li>What, according to Rachels, are some main reasons not to accept cultural relativism about morality?</li>
<li>Do Rachels's reasons not to accept cultural relativism about morality show that it is false? Why or why not?</li>
<li>What, according to Rachels, can we learn from cultural relativism, even if we do not accept it?</li>
<li>What does Epictetus suggest we need to do to live well? Why would that amount to living well, according to him?</li>
<li>What is Nozick's main conclusion from his experience-machine thought experiment? How does he argue for it?</li>
<li>What are the main differences between the two formal accounts of well-being that Tiberius presents?</li>
<li>How, as presented by Tiberius, does Nussbaum support her substantive account of well-being?</li>
<li>What, according to Wolf, is the key difference between a life that is meaningful and one that is not? Why?</li>
